AudioProcessingEngine
=====================
Mix and Synthetize audio data - by parsing tone scripts,... independently from (supported) data types and channel constellations


### Supported data types:

- 8bit, 16bit, 24bit signed integer data
- 32bit, 64bit floating point data

*I was thinking of adding also half precission (16bit-float) support,.. but since even these days today now - there still is no hardware interface  available whic is supporting 16bit-floats... so best practice I think still is using 24bit integers anyway,...

### Supported channel constellations:

- mono, stereo, quadro
- 5.1, 7.1
